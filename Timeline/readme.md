# Vertical Timeline
A simple vertical timeline created with HTML and CSS. Each timeline point is animated to slide into view from the top of the page. The timeline is responsive and works well on mobile devices. The timeline is built using the following technologies:

* HTML
* CSS
* Animation with keyframes

The timeline is built using the following structure:

* A container element with a class of "timeline" which contains all the timeline points.
* Each timeline point is contained within a "container" div element.
* Each container element contains a heading element with a class of "heading" and a paragraph element with a class of "text".
* The timeline points are positioned relative and the animation is applied to each timeline point using the "@keyframes" property.
* The animation is set to start when the container element is loaded into the page with the "animation-delay" property.

The timeline is responsive and works well on mobile devices. The media query in the CSS file is used to change the width of the timeline points and the spacing between them on mobile devices. The timeline points are also centered on mobile devices.
